= Development notes for Python SDK

This SDK provides two edge clients (a Streaming one based on urllib3's `sseclient-py`), and a polling one based entirely on `urllib3`. Both rely on threads to keep themselves alive, so if your server can't support multithreading you will need to periodically poll yourself and set the polling interval to 0.

== Current issues:

- logging - decisions and where and how and what to log
- open telemetry baggage support is not in place
- analytics are missing

== Repo issues
- needs reporting on how much test coverage we have
- needs beta testing!

== Python problems
- couldn't figure out how to do property mocks
- async + urllib3 testing is  ðŸ¤¯
